# Prompt 8: AI Persona

## Readings

* Sasha Stiles, _Technelegy_

### Practical

* [OpenAI Chat Completion API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)

## Summary

Our reading of Sasha Stiles' _Technelegy_ surfaces an idea about robotic (i.e. ML/AI) "intelligence" through creating an alter ego or persona. This
assignment has you completing the same task -- and another -- predicated on learning the limits of persona as it expresses itself in a
computational medium. Largely, your two tasks:

* Create a persona-driven "game" that revolves around negotiation to achieve a goal in collaboration with your constructed chatbot
* Create an alter-ego for yourself in chatbot form considering what digital opportunities this affords and how it changes your conception of "you"

## Goals

* Exploring "System" prompts written to govern and delimit interaction
* Discussing the ways in which models succeed or fail at creating believable or rounded personas
* (Potentially) Discovering other exploitable boundaries and what these offer
  * This is the method that folks use to "jailbreak" GPT

## Outcomes

* `1` persona-based "game" which requires negotiation as a mechanic
* `1` persona-based chatbot (using the `SYSTEM` prompt) which elaborates characteristics of the chatbot's persona in detail
* writing in the [writing/journal.md](writing/journal.md) which answers broad questions about the experience of both prompts

## Process

This assignment requires you to use the OpenAI library to access image generation at the scale and quality we need. The implementation
provided is complete. It requires a `.env` file placed in the `src` directory of the repository. The instructor has shared this with you, and can
provide it again if needed.
